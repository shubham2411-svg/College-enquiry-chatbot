# College Chatbot System

## Overview

This repository contains the code for a chatbot system designed to answer queries related to a college. The chatbot uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a deep learning model built with **TensorFlow**'s **Keras** library. The system recognizes various user intents from input text and provides appropriate responses based on predefined patterns. This chatbot can be integrated into college websites or platforms to assist students and staff with frequently asked questions.

## Features

- **Intent Recognition**: Identifies the user's intent based on their input.
- **Response Generation**: Provides predefined responses for recognized intents.
- **NLP-Based**: Uses tokenization, lemmatization, and other NLP techniques to understand user input.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Trained using a neural network model with TensorFlow/Keras to classify user inputs into intents.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**: The programming language used to build the chatbot.
- **TensorFlow**: A deep learning framework used to build and train the model.
- **Keras**: A high-level neural network API for TensorFlow.
- **nltk (Natural Language Toolkit)**: For text preprocessing tasks like tokenization and lemmatization.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and data handling.
- **Pickle**: For serializing and saving Python objects, such as the trained model and data.
- **JSON**: For structuring chatbot intents, patterns, and responses.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python 3.x**: The chatbot requires Python 3.6 or higher.
  - Download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Required Python Libraries**: Install the following Python libraries using `pip`:
  ```bash
  pip install nltk tensorflow numpy pickle
